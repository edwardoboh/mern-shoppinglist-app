## MERN STACK SHOPPING LIST APP

#### My first complete MERN project. A shopping List App built using React, Nodejs, Express, Mongoose and some other popular Js Libraries

### Running the App on your local machine:

1. Ensure nodejs is installed, you can download and install it from [this](https://nodejs.org/) link or from nodesource.

1. Install Git in your machine following instaructions from [this](https://git-scm.com/) web page.

1. Clone the repository into a folder with Git bash (for windows users) or your terminal (for linux and mac users) using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwardoboh/mern-shoppinglist-app.git
cd mern-shoppinglist-app
npm run install
```

4. Enter your mongoDB username and password in the default.json file present in the config folder.
